This was a project I completed with three other CS majors in the Summer of 2022. It's a web application that's built on the Java Spring framework, Thymeleaf for the frontend-backend interactions, and Bootstrap CSS/HTML for the frontend.

Functionality: A basic to-do list application, but with extra features...
1)   Create an account, individual or with a group id to join other users
2)   Log in/log out at will
3)   Assign a task to yourself or others within your group
4)   View all self-created and assigned tasks
5)   Group tasks into custom groupings
6)   Mark tasks complete
7)   Search for tasks within the list using keywords

This project allowed me to exercise backend development, as I wrote many of the methods for collecting/editing data from the database. I also was in charge of configuring the AWS SQL database we used (which is now permanently offline for monetary reasons). We followed the Agile development strategy to build it from scratch. Although it is a simple concept for a web app, I consider this a good showcase of leadership/teamwork, practicing technologies/languages used in web app development, and getting hands-on with concepts beyond coding, like database architecture design.
